## Multi-scale Cnn for Gesture Recognition

We provide our implementation of multi-path multi-scale CNN for skeleton-based gesture recognition. Here we only open source the code and data needed for testing on the ChaLearning 2013, which is the largest public dataset for this task. We will later open source the whole training and test code and data on the ChaLearning 2013, ChaLearning 2016, MSRC 12 dataset.

## Requirement
tensorflow=1.9.0
numpy
h5py
