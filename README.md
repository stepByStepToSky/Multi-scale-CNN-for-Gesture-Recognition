## Multi-scale Cnn for Gesture Recognition

The tensorflow implementation of Multi-path multi-scale CNN for gesture recognition. Here we only open source the code and data needed for testing on the ChaLearning 2013. We will later open source the whole training and test code and data on the ChaLearning 2013, ChaLearning 2016, MSRC 12 dataset.

## Requirement
tensorflow==1.9.0
